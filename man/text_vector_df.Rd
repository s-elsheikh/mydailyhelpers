\title{Deprecated: Search for specific text in a tibble text column}
\usage{
text_vector_df(
  df,
  col_to_search,
  output_col,
  search_text,
  b_win = 10,
  f_win = 80
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Tibble containing a character column. A unique identifier is expected in
the first column.}

\item{col_to_search}{Unquoted column name in \code{df} to search.}

\item{output_col}{Unquoted name for the new column that would have contained search results.}

\item{search_text}{Quoted string: regex pattern to search for. Lowercase letters only.}

\item{b_win}{Integer: number of characters before the search string to include in the snippet.}

\item{f_win}{Integer: number of characters after the search string to include in the snippet.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value; it always stops with an error.
Originally, it returned a tibble with one row per match, and the second column
contained the requested output column.
}
\description{
This function is \strong{deprecated}. Use \code{locate_text_to_vector()} instead.
It was used to search a character column in a tibble for a regex pattern
and return a new column with snippets of text surrounding each match.
The second column of the returned tibble contains the search results.
