\title{Extract text snippets around a search term in a data frame column}
\usage{
locate_text_to_vector(
  df,
  col_to_search,
  pattern,
  back_window = 10,
  front_window = 80
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble.}

\item{col_to_search}{The column in \code{df} to search (unquoted).}

\item{pattern}{A string or regular expression to search for.}

\item{back_window}{Number of characters to include before the match (default: 10).}

\item{front_window}{Number of characters to include after the match (default: 80).}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per match. Contains all original columns
plus a new column \code{snippet} with the extracted text.
The \code{snippet} column is always placed in the second position
of the returned data frame for easier viewing in the console.
If no matches are found in a row, the snippet is \code{NA}.
}
\description{
Searches a character column in a data frame for a pattern, and returns
a new data frame where each match is on its own row, along with a
snippet of text surrounding the match. The search is case-insensitive,
but the returned snippet preserves the original casing.
}
\examples{
library(dplyr)

df <- tibble(
  id = 1:3,
  text = c(
    "This is a keyword in the middle of the sentence for testing.",
    "Another keyword appears here, and another keyword later.",
    "No match here."
  )
)

locate_text_to_vector(df, text, "keyword", 5, 15)
